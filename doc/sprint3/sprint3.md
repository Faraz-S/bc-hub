We completed the sp3 planning meeting on March 7th. As from sprint2, we decided to implement  user authentication and authorization, as well as more features on the following pages:

* Community
* My Profile page (new)
* Register/Login page
 
For the Community page, our goal was to make the user experience more interactive and efficient. The like/dislike feature (BH-5) would allow users to express their opinion on any social media post and comment. Similarly, the share feature (BH-9) would allow users to easily share posts which they liked on various different platforms (facebook, twitter, linkedin). Furthermore, the search bar feature (BH-8), would allow users to easily find their desired topic rather than scrolling through all posts. 

For the My Profile page (BH-15) our goal was to create a new section allowing users to keep track of their social media posts, followers, users they’re following, as well as followed currencies. Grouping all these items into one section would make user experience more accessible and efficient, as a user could find all their important information in one place. 

For the Register/Login page (BH-4), our goal was to create a new section allowing users to login and have authorization to interact with all features, making a more interactive user experience.. New users would be able to create a new account, and existing users would be able to login to their current account.

The user stories that we are going to implement in this sprint are the following:
* BH-4
* BH-9
* BH-15
* BH-8
* BH-5

The team capacity for this sprint is 32 points

There are no spikes in this sprint. With these chosen user stories, the team has enough info about the feature’s that we are going to implement, hence why no spikes are being introduced yet.
