On Monday, January 31st, 2022, we had our release planning meeting for sprint 1 on the CSC301 Discord. The meeting was attended by all seven group members, with activly participating in the discussion. Our goal for this release is to lay the groundowrk for the following, four main components of our application:
* Social Media
* Market
* News
* Education

For Social Media, our goal is to implement the basic componenets and layout of a social media post, as well as display these posts in two types of feeds. These goals relate to user story BH-3. We want to be able to click on posts to view more information (comment sections and full descriptions). We also want to implement a functioning personal feed and trending section. Since user authentication will be implemented in a later sprint, the personal feed will contain posts from the entire userbase (instead of who the user follows) in a reverse-chronological order. The Trending feed will contain posts from the past 24 hours, sorted by decreasing like count.

With the Market section, our goal is learn how to retireve market information through existing cryptocurrency APIs and display the market information in an clear and intuitive user interface. These goals relate to user story BH-12. We would like to display prices, charts and other statistics for various currencies on one page, and allow users to see more info about the currency by clicking on the currency's name.

For the News section, our goal is display crypto-currency news from various credible sources in one newsfeed. This goal correlates with user story BH-7.

For the Education section, the goal is to research crypto-currency concepts and definitions from credible sources, and then display the information in one, simple-to-navigate section to educate new users on the crypto-currency space. This goal relates to the user story BH-1. This section is intended for new-comers to cryptocurrency, not experts, so the content in this section will cover basic concepts in the field.

The scope of this project is four high priority user stories (two worth 8 points and the other two worth 4 points).
