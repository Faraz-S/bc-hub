On Sunday January 30th, 2022, we had our release planning meeting on the team discord server. The meeting was attended by all seven group members (Sahil, Faraz, Kesavar, Nathan, Ryan, Hongting and Keith) with active participation from all group members. During the meeting, our team discussed the goals of the release, the scope of the project, and what we wanted the final application to look like.

One goal of the release is to build an application that is easy to use, looks visually appealing, and useful for lots of people. Another goal is to provide users an application that has almost all of their crypto-related needs.


## Project Scope

There are a few things that are key to our application.

Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are gaining more and more popularity, but not many people are knowledgeable about them, so we will dedicate an entire page to education. This page will point users to useful resources to learn more about the field [BH-1].

We want to provide beginners and experts alike a platform to discuss cryptocurrency with others, so social media is a big part of our application. Users will have to ability to make their own posts [BH-2] and have customized feeds based on the people they follow [BH-11]. To promote discussion, users can comment on posts [BH-6] and/or express their opinion via likes/dislikes [BH-5].

Past and current information about cryptocurrencies such as prices and charts are important for investors to make their decisions. So to support our goal of providing users an application that has almost all of their crypto-related needs, our application will have a market section that displays up-to-date as well as historical information about different cryptocurrencies [BH-12].
