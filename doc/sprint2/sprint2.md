We completed the sp2 meeting on Feb 14th, Monday. As from sprint1, we decided to implement more features of the following 4 pages:

* Social Media
* Market
* News
* Landing Page
 

For Social Media, our goal is to enhance the user experience. We will have a sidebar for quicker navigation which is related to the BH-40. We will also finish the posting function (BH-2), like/dislike feature (BH-5), deleting post function (BH-17) for the logged-in users and commenting on posts (BH-6).

With the Market section, a search feature (BH-14) would come in handy. Besides, for users to follow a specific currency (BH-10, BH-13) could enhance the user experience.

For the News section, we have News being set up but the page has a lot of space. We want to implement a search function (BH-16) so the user can search the topic in mind.

Each page is accessible via the navbar, however there is no landing page currently. We need a landing page (BH-41) for the website to give users a proper starting point on the website and to show what features the website has.



The user stories that we are going to implement in this sprint are the following:
* BH-16
* BH-40
* BH-41
* BH-2
* BH-5
* BH-6
* BH-17
* BH-14
* BH-13
* BH-18
* BH-47

The team capacity for this sprint is 39 points

There are no spikes in this sprint. With these chosen user stories, the team has enough info about the featureâ€™s that we are going to implement, hence why no spikes are being introduced yet.
