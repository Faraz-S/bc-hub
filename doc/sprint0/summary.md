Objective: Build an easy to use web application about the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The web app provides useful information for beginners to get introduced to this field. It also has information for non-beginners and features for anyone interested in the topic to use. The application is a hub for all things crypto/NFT related. It contains social media, news, market, and education sections.

Key Users:

John is 28 years old and works a 9-5 office job 5 days a week. His salary is average and he is always looking for new ways to grow his money with investments. He likes talking about finance with just about anyone.

Emma is 29 years old and works as a financial advisor at a big bank. She has a Master of Business Analytics and knows a lot about the finance and investing industry. Her dream is to have a personal consultant company and she needs an easy-to-use website for her future clients to understand digital currency. 

Key Usage Scenarios: 

John’s friends at the office were talking about buying cryptocurrencies. John has heard of cryptocurrencies but he doesn’t know much about them. He doesn’t want to miss out and needs something that will introduce him to crypto and show him how to get started.

Emma has clients in her association of consulting who are mostly aged 30-50 and have no experience in digital investment. She needs a site that is user-friendly to educate her client about new investments. At the same time, Emma wants to see what other investors think so she can have a benchmark for her clients. 

Key Principles: 

The application should be easy to use and navigate. It should have a clean UI, one that is not cluttered. A good user experience should be prioritized over everything.

The app needs to be useful for beginners and non-beginners. The number of features that beginners can use and the number of features non-beginners can use should be almost equal. The app should help transition beginners to have intermediate knowledge in the field, while also providing tools to experts that satisfy their cryptocurrency-related needs.
