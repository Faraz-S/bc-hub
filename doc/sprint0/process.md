### Decision-making

We follow a democratic decision making process. Each team member is expected to present his own ideas to the group. Once all ideas are presented to the group, the group discusses the pros and cons of each idea. At the end of the discussion period, each member gets a certain number of votes and votes for the idea(s) that he prefers. The idea with the highest number of votes is chosen.

Example: We used this process to decide on the project topic. Each member had his own idea that he presented and after much discussion and two rounds of voting, we decided on our current topic – cryptocurrency – as the topic received the highest number of votes.

### Priority/user stories

To determine the priority/user stories, we adopted the planning poker technique to estimate the amount of complexity of each task. Each team member iteratively estimates the amount of effort required until a consensus is reached.

### Next phase

One challenge that we faced was scheduling meetings. Due to our differing schedules, we faced difficulty in setting the meeting time of our first meeting and had to undergo many rounds of checking if a certain time is suitable for all team members before deciding on the final meeting time.

After our first meeting, we improved upon the process by sharing our timetables with each other and identifying the time slots where all of us are available. This, however, did not completely resolve the problem due to unforeseen circumstances.

Going forward, we have learnt that it is important for us to be flexible with our schedules and maintain a clear line of communication with team members. Proper communication and flexibility within our team will ensure that our meetings can go smoothly.
