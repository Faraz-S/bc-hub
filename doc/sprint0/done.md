The project is complete when a client can sign in, view information about NFTs/crypto, view posts, search through NFTs and crypto for additional information. In addition to the previous, a client with an account should be able to login and delete their account, make and delete posts, comment on posts, follow and unfollow NFTs, cryptos, and other users, and should be able to access their personal newsfeed.
