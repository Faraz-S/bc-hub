There are existing products that provide some of the features of our
app, but none provide all of our proposed features. This makes our app
stand apart from the competitors as it truly makes it a hub for the
crypto currency space. Here are a few competitors to our app:

-   Reddit (Specifically crypto currency related subreddits like r/NFT,
    r/CryptoCurrency and r/Bitcoin)
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/NFT/
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/
    -   Reddit has subreddits for different topics in crypto currency.
        Users can post to specific subreddits, and if they join them,
        they can have content from that subreddit appear on their home
        feed. Our app's social media side will instead allow users to
        follow other users, where the posts from the users they follow
        will appear on their feed, and their own posts will appear on
        the feeds of users that follow them. It will also have an
        explore page where they can see popular posts from people that
        they are not following. On top of this, our app has a dedicated
        section for news, educational info and charts and prices for
        currencies, things that reddit does not have.
    -   Our app is better for new-comers to the cryptocurrency space, as
        there will be certain scenarios where a user might read a post
        about a topic that they are unfamiliar with. If this user was on
        reddit, they would have to then google this topic to learn more
        about it. If they were using our app, they could quickly switch
        to the education side of our app to learn this topic. A similar
        scenario arises for all users, where for example someone might
        post that a certain currency is doing really well. A user can
        then switch to our market section to see the price of this
        currency and what its value has been over time. Reddit as a
        whole is a social media application, and these topic specific
        subreddits can only diverge so far from the base subreddit
        formula, so crypto specific features like definitions, prices
        etc are not going to be provided. Reddit houses communities for
        everything, not just crypto currency, so making features for
        each of the hundreds of thousands of subreddits would be very
        expensive and quite infeasible, hence why they don't focus on
        these scenarios.
    -   This app's social media section is also better than reddit's as
        users can choose who they follow based on the content they post.
        A more serious trader might have to waste time scrolling through
        satirical content to get to more informational posts in
        r/Bitcoin. On our app, this user can simply choose who they
        follow to make sure their feed is filled with the type of posts
        that they actually want. Reddit doesn't focus on users that want
        one specific type of content from a particular subreddit because
        the subreddit itself is for the base topic. If a user wants a
        subset of content from a subreddit, then that user would just
        have to find a new subreddit, or create one themselves. Both
        options would likely have a smaller community.
-   Cryptocurrency trading websites
    -   https://www.binance.com/en
    -   https://bitbuy.ca/en/
    -   These sites provide users with the ability to buy/sell
        cryptocurrency, view prices and statistics, as well as learn
        about the subject. Our app will also provide users with
        educational material, as well as prices and stats about crypto,
        but it won't have functionality for trading cryptocurrency. As
        mentioned before, our app will also provide a social media
        section.
    -   Our social media section, which these websites lack, makes our
        site better for user interaction. Buying and selling crypto has
        become a hobby that some users would want to share with others.
        We believe these competitors avoided this user interaction as
        they wanted to focus on the core of their business, which is
        buying and selling crypto, while leaving the user interaction
        aspect to other apps like twitter and reddit. Users still have
        to register to use these trading applications, so a user base
        already exists. From there, they can add functionality such as
        tweeting about a sale or trend directly from the app, or adding
        a comment section under each currencies page.
