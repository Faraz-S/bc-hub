We completed the sp4 planning meeting on March 21th. As from sprint3, we decided to implement user authentication and authorization, internal media post sharing, following and unfollowing users and crypto currencies, as well as more features on the following pages:

* My Profile page
* Market page
* News page
* Education page

For the My Profile page our goal was to update the page to display information relevant to the logged in user (BH-98). This would allow for a user to see information about themselves on their profile page including their name, email, followers, followed crypto currencies, education progress, and posts.

For the Market page our goal was to improve the visual quality and clarity of the page (BH-83), update the page to display the logged in user's information (BH-98), and include a new interactable simulation of cryptocurrencies (BH-20). This would allow for a user to quickly see crypto currencies that they would like to view as well as learn and practice with investing in crypto currencies.

For the News page our goal was to improve the visual quality and clarity of the page (BH-83).

For the Education page our goal was to update the page to display information relevant to the logged in user (BH-98). This would allow for a user to properly view their education progress.

The user stories that we are going to implement in this sprint are the following:

* BH-4
* BH-10
* BH-11
* BH-19
* BH-98
* BH-37
* BH-83
* BH-20

The team capacity for this sprint is 33 points.

There are no spikes in this sprint. With these chosen user stories, the team has enough info about the featureâ€™s that we are going to implement, hence why no spikes are being introduced yet.
